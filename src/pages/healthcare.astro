              <p>Healthcare transformation is accelerating. Advances in precision medicine, particularly radioligand, cell, and gene therapies, are rapidly reshaping what "treatment" means to both individuals and healthcare industries. Instead of manufacturing drugs at scale, pharmaceutical companies are expected to deliver <strong>highly orchestrated, end-to-end treatment experiences for</strong> individual patients.</p>
              <p>However, most pharma companies are not ready for the challenge with their infrastructure today. This wasn't a marketing problem or a logistics puzzle. It was a service design challenge disguised as a product launch. And the clock was ticking.</p>

              <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>A leading pharmaceutical company asked us to launch their breakthrough radioligand therapy (RLT). The brief seemed straightforward <em>"We need an ordering platform for the successful delivery of this therapy"</em></p>
              <p>But a rapid discovery phase revealed a deeper challenge. I'm not tasked with designing an ordering tool, but designing for the real need: an end-to-end service ecosystem required to deliver it successfully and sustainably across global markets.</p>
              <p>Here's what made it truly complex: <strong>the organisation didn't think this way.</strong> Teams were siloed by function. "Customer experience" meant sales support, not patient outcomes. No one had ever designed a service where the entire treatment journey was the product.</p>
              <p>My job was to make them see it, and then build it.</p>

            <p>Everyone agreed the therapy was critical. No one agreed on what "successful delivery" meant. Through multi-market research, cross-team workshops, and strategic synthesis and journey mapping, we created the <strong>first shared understanding</strong> of how RLT must operate as a service.</p>
            <p>Medical cared about clinical protocols. Commercial wanted market metrics. Supply chain obsessed over timelines. IT thought this was a portal project. As one Health Care System team member said "I had no idea supply chain was dealing with this…"</p>
            <p>The clarity convinced leadership and teams across medical, CX, supply chain, IT, and commercial to finally saw the same system and rally around one unified vision.</p>
            <p>The alignment didn't happen overnight, It took several rounds of working sessions to build a strategy and vision that honored each domain's expertise, gave leadership the full picture, and reflected what HCPs and patients actually needed.</p>

              <p>RLT delivery varies dramatically by geography. Regulations, clinical pathways, patient expectations, and infrastructure differ across markets. For instance, the referral network that works in Brazil simply won't work in Germany.</p>
              <p>I developed a structured localisation methodology: a flexible framework with core principles and adaptable components.
